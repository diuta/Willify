            <p>
              <br />[Verse 1] <br />Through thick and thin <br />Good times
              and bad <br />To stop you drinking the Kool-Aid <br />And hold
              you when you're sad <br />A shoulder to cry on <br />A hoodie to
              wear <br />Somebody that calls up <br />Just to let you know
              they care
              <br />
              <br />[Pre-Chorus] <br />We let the lines get blurry <br />Now
              both of us are hurting
              <br />
              <br />[Chorus] <br />You knew I wasn't ready <br />I'm too
              unsteady <br />Don't make me make the call <br />This doesn't
              have to be the end <br />You gave me an ultimatum <br />You said
              verbatim <br />"If you want me, take it all <br />Or you'll
              never see my face again" <br />Guess I'll never see your face
              again <br />'Cause we were never really friends
              <br />
              <br />[Verse 2] <br />I crashed my Mercedes <br />Somewhere near
              the coast <br />I couldn't reach you <br />When I needed you the
              most <br />And that night I got roofied <br />And passed out on
              the floor <br />When I asked you to come home <br />You said
              you'd rather dance alone
              <br />
              <br />[Pre-Chorus] <br />We let the lines get blurry <br />Now
              both of us are hurting
              <br />
              <br />[Chorus] <br />You knew I wasn't ready <br />I'm too
              unsteady <br />Don't make me make the call <br />This doesn't
              have to be the end <br />You gave me an ultimatum <br />You said
              verbatim <br />"If you want me, take it all <br />Or you'll
              never see my face again" <br />Guess I'll never see your face
              again
              <br />
              <br />[Outro] <br />Baby, we finally reached the end
              <br />'Cause we were never really friends
